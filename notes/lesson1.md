# Lesson 1

A compiler has 2 parts:
1. Lexer: part that creates words
2. Parser: part that creates sentences (in free form)


## Parser

The parser will form a tree structure with the tokens generated by the Lexer.
so e.g. 1 + 2 * 3

Will result into:

  +
 / \
1   *
   / \
  2   3


**Problem**: the parser is a _recursive descent parser_. If we parse naively,  expressions like 1 + 2 * 3 will be evaluated to be 9. However, when we take into account mathematical priorities the result should be 7, something that is solved using recursive descent.
